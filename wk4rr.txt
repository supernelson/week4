1. Variable is an object which stores information. A programmer may want to modified that information or use it at a later point.

2. Ruby will run “first_name” then concatenate it with “last_name”. Then it stores the string “Abraham Lincoln” to “full_name”.

3. A string is notated between “ “. It is typically words.
Integer is a number without decimals.
Float is a number with decimals. 
Nil is nothing. It’s an empty placeholder.
Boolean is a true or false statement.

4. An Algorithm is a set of instructions.  

5. Sorting algorithms and Matching Algorithms.

6. Methods are an encapsulated set of instructions that returns a value. A method is useful for more complex needs.

7. Return Value: when a method is run this is the result that gets spit back out to the user.

Side Effect - when you change one part of an expression which alters something in the outside or the calling function.

Parameter - a value that a method uses to define variables to be inserted. 

Argument - these are the actual values inserted when a method is called.

Implicit Return - will continue through to the end of the code whereas an explicit return will stop (e.g. return).

8. Global Scope means the information within that method are accessible from anywhere. Method scope means the information living within it can only be called within that method.

9. Control flow is a way of directing traffic, like a decision tree. 

10. loop - take some code and has it go around and around and around, usually changing a variable.

if - paired with elsif & else to create a decision tree.

else - the “ending” part of the if statement which is the final option.

elsif - in an if/else statement sometimes it makes sense to have more than two branches so the elsif is to add more decisions.

while - this is a loop that goes for as long as a condition is met.

until - also a loop that goes up till a condition is met.
